While the [Pipeline Tutorial](pipeline-tutorial-1/index.html) provides a high level overview and a more convenient, preconstructred pipeline, this tool aims to explain the building blocks behind it so that users can understand and learn how to construct their own pipelines and/or modify the existing pipeline presented in the [Pipeline Tutorial](pipeline-tutorial-1/index.html).\n",

    "### MOL2 Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools presented in this tutorial can work with MOL2 files of arbitrary size. However, to minimize the computation time for the purposes of illustration, we are only going to use a small subset of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical use case for these would be the screening of all ~18,000,000 *Drug-Like* molecules from [ZINC](http://zinc.docking.org), which is available in MOL2 format on ZINC [here](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like). Please note that screenlamp supports both Tripos MOL2 (`*.mol2`) files and gzipped Tripos MOL2 files (`*.mol2.gz`) out of the box. Thus, if your input dataset is in gzipped format, you can use it right away without having to make any adjustments or decompressing it. However, please not that the decompressing and compressing operations that are performed when working with gzipped files have an additional toll on computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With kind permission from John Irwin and the ZINC team, we are using a random subset of 70,000 small molecules that we prepared for this tutorial. This subset from ZINC is split into 7 multi-MOL2 file with 10,000 molecules each: `partition_mol2_1.mol2` to `partition_mol2_7.mol2`. \n",

Although the partitions you downloaded above are only a small, modified subset of [ZINC](http://zinc.docking.org) molecules, we are going to use the full ~18,000,000 molecule Drug-like table available for download at [http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like). To download the tab-separated table, click on the [Properties](http://zinc.docking.org/db/bysubset/3/3_prop.xls) link on the [ZINC Drug-like](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like) page. Please note that the size of the datatable is about ~1.8 Gb, and thus, the download may take a while depending on your internet connection. Alternatively, we recommend using a smaller datatable containing only ~170,000 molecules; to download this table, please use the following link: [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenlamp-datasets/pipeline-tutorial_1/small_table_p1-7.txt](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenlamp-datasets/pipeline-tutorial_1/small_table_p1-7.txt)\n",

Then, after this criterion has been applied to select the specified subset of molecules, the next criterion will be applied, the criterion followed by the '-->' string. In this case, the second criterion is to check the remaining molecules for the presence of an 'O.2' atom. In this context, you can think of the '-->' string as a \"THEN\" conditional statement. E.g., \"select via filter ((atom_type == 'S.3') | (atom_type == 'S.o2')) THEN select via filter (atom_type == 'O.2')\"\n",

However, the selection string \"((atom_type == 'S.3') & (atom_type == 'S.o2'))\" would mean that a molecule must contain an atom that has the type S.3 AND S.o2, which is impossible, because an atom can only have 1 type at the same time (in the MOL2 file format).\n"

    "Generating low-energy conformers of either database or reference molecule is highly recommended to account for the flexibility of molecules (for instance, rotatatable bonds) when overlaying molecules (in the next step, \"Step 5 -- Overlaying Reference and Database molecules\"). However, note that working with low-energy conformers increases the computational cost involved in computing the optimal overlays. For example, assuming that we have 10,000 database molecules and 1 reference molecule, generating 200 low-energy conformers of each of those database molecules would result in a database of 10,000x200 = 2,000,000 molecules. Consequently we will have to sample 2,000,000x1 overlays (200 overlays per database molecule) instead of 10,000 overlays to obtain the best-overlaying pairs. To take it a step further, we could also consider multiple conformers of the reference molecule. For example, if we create 200 conformers of the 1 reference molecule as well, we will have to overlay 2000,000x200 = 40,000,000 pairs. To summarize, the three different options as input for overlaying the reference molecule with the database molecule are given below, in increasing order of computational cost, which is proportional to the thoroughness of the sampling procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Overlay a single conformer for both database and the reference molecule\n",
    "2) Overlay a single reference molecule conformer with multiple database molecule conformers\n",
    "3) Overlay multiple reference molecule conformers with multiple database molecule conformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use option 3), where we create up to 200 conformers of each database molecule using OpenEye Omega and overlay them with an existing multiconformer reference molecule that is already provided with the tutorial files (`3kpzs_query.mol2`, which contains 35 favorable-energy conformers of the reference molecule 3kPZS).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, please note the creating multiple conformers of a molecule is optional. The program we are going to use is OpenEye Omega, but you may use alternative tools as well, as long as they can output those conformer structures in MOL2 file format. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Please also note that the conformers of a given molecule (database or reference molecule) files should have the same molecule ID in the MOL2 files in order to parse the output of \"Step 5 -- Overlaying Reference and Database molecules\" without additional workarounds. For example, if you have a multiconformer MOL2 file such as `3kpzs_query.mol2`, make sure that the molecule IDs in the MOL2 file are all \"3kPZS\" and don't have any suffixes or prefixes such as \"3kPZS_1, 3KPZS_2, ...\". The reason why we want to avoid prefixes and suffixes in those conformer names is that the overlay tool OpenEye ROCS identifies conformers by their structure, not their names, and such molecule IDs would only result in annoying name mangling, which makes the results harder to parse downstream in the analysis pipeline.**"

The `run_rocs.py` wrapper uses ROCs' default settings plus additional settings provided by a `--settings argument`. For more information about the ROCS settings, please refer to the official documentation at https://www.eyesopen.com/rocs. The settings we are going to use will overlay each query conformer with each database conformer, and it will only keep the best overlay for each multiconformer per. For instance, if we have 200 conformers of a database molecule A and 200 conformers of a reference molecule B, only the best overlay out of the 200x200 overlays will be kept."

    "Essentially, the `sort_rocs_mol2.py` tool will create a pair of `*_query.mol2` and `*_dbase.mol2` files that contain the same number of structures each based on the ROCS overlays. The `*_dbase.mol2` file contains the database molecule and the `*_query.mol2` contains the conformer of the reference molecule that corresponds to the best-matching database-reference pair. In addition, we use the --sortby function to sort the molecules by TanimotoCombo and ColorTanimoto score (in descending order, best matches come first) for visualization and remove bad overlays by setting minumum score thresholds based on the TanimotoCombo and ColorTanimoto similarity scores. The TanimotoCombo scores measures the similarity between a pair of molecules based on the overall volumetric match (ShapeTanimoto) and the electrostatic similarity (ColorTanimoto). For more information about the different scoring metrics implemented in ROCS, please refer to the official ROCS documentation at https://www.eyesopen.com/rocs"
