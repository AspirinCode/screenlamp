### A toolkit for ligand-based virtual screening


Screenlamp is a Python package for facilitating ligand-based virtual screening workflows and toolkits with hypothesis-driven filtering steps.

**The official documentation is available at https://psa-lab.github.io/screenlamp.**


## About

The screenlamp toolkit was developed in the [Protein Structure Analysis & Design Laboratory](http://www.kuhnlab.bmb.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. For additional information about screenlamp, please refer to the accompanying research publication, which is currently under revision:

- Raschka, Sebastian, Anne M. Scott, Nan Liu, Santosh Gunturu, Mar Huertas, Weiming Li, and Leslie A. Kuhn (2017). "Enabling the hypothesis-driven prioritization of ligand candidates in big databases: 
Screenlamp and its application to GPCR inhibitor discovery for invasive species control"


Screenlamp is research software and has been made available to other researchers under a permissive [Apache v2 open source license](license).
