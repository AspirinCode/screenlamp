While the [Pipeline Tutorial](pipeline-tutorial-1/index.html) provides a high level overview and a more convenient, preconstructred pipeline, this tool aims to explain the building blocks behind it so that users can understand and learn how to construct their own pipelines and/or modify the existing pipeline presented in the [Pipeline Tutorial](pipeline-tutorial-1/index.html).\n",

    "### MOL2 Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools presented in this tutorial can work with MOL2 files of arbitrary size. However, to minimize the computation time for the purposes of illustration, we are only going to use a small subset of molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical use case for these would be the screening of all ~18,000,000 *Drug-Like* molecules from [ZINC](http://zinc.docking.org), which is available in MOL2 format on ZINC [here](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like). Please note that screenlamp supports both Tripos MOL2 (`*.mol2`) files and gzipped Tripos MOL2 files (`*.mol2.gz`) out of the box. Thus, if your input dataset is in gzipped format, you can use it right away without having to make any adjustments or decompressing it. However, please not that the decompressing and compressing operations that are performed when working with gzipped files have an additional toll on computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With kind permission from John Irwin and the ZINC team, we are using a random subset of 70,000 small molecules that we prepared for this tutorial. This subset from ZINC is split into 7 multi-MOL2 file with 10,000 molecules each: `partition_mol2_1.mol2` to `partition_mol2_7.mol2`. \n",

Although the partitions you downloaded above are only a small, modified subset of [ZINC](http://zinc.docking.org) molecules, we are going to use the full ~18,000,000 molecule Drug-like table available for download at [http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like). To download the tab-separated table, click on the [Properties](http://zinc.docking.org/db/bysubset/3/3_prop.xls) link on the [ZINC Drug-like](http://zinc.docking.org/subsets/drug-like) page. Please note that the size of the datatable is about ~1.8 Gb, and thus, the download may take a while depending on your internet connection. Alternatively, we recommend using a smaller datatable containing only ~170,000 molecules; to download this table, please use the following link: [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenlamp-datasets/pipeline-tutorial_1/small_table_p1-7.txt](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/screenlamp-datasets/pipeline-tutorial_1/small_table_p1-7.txt)\n",

Then, after this criterion has been applied to select the specified subset of molecules, the next criterion will be applied, the criterion followed by the '-->' string. In this case, the second criterion is to check the remaining molecules for the presence of an 'O.2' atom. In this context, you can think of the '-->' string as a \"THEN\" conditional statement. E.g., \"select via filter ((atom_type == 'S.3') | (atom_type == 'S.o2')) THEN select via filter (atom_type == 'O.2')\"\n",

However, the selection string \"((atom_type == 'S.3') & (atom_type == 'S.o2'))\" would mean that a molecule must contain an atom that has the type S.3 AND S.o2, which is impossible, because an atom can only have 1 type at the same time (in the MOL2 file format).\n"
