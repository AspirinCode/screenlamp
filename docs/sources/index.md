### A toolkit for ligand-based virtual screening


Screenlamp is a Python package for facilitating ligand-based virtual screening workflows and toolkits with hypothesis-driven filtering steps.


## About

The screenlamp toolkit was developed in the [Protein Structure Analysis & Design Laboratory](http://www.kuhnlab.bmb.msu.edu) at Michigan State University. For additional information about screenlamp, please refer to the accompanying research publication, which is currently under revision:
